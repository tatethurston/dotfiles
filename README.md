# Tate's dotfiles

### What is this?

My personal dotfiles for MacOS.

### Getting started

Run `./bin/setup`

`setup` will download all necessary dependencies and symlink them to the home directory.

Any conflicting dotfiles will be moved to `/backup` in this repo. These
can be restored by running `./bin/unlink`.
